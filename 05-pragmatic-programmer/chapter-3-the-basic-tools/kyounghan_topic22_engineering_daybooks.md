# Engineering Daybooks
## Daybooks of electronic and mechanical engineers
- They'd been trained to keep an engineering daybook.
- A kind of journal in which recoreded in most aspect of work
    - What they did
    - The things they'd learned
    - Sketches of ideas
    - readings from meters
    - Basically anything to do with their work.
- When the notebook became full, it kept with date range on the spine
- When the notebook became full, it was kept after writing date range on the spine with previous ones.

## Days books for programmers
We use daybooks 
- to take notes in meeting
- to jot down what we're working on
- to note variable values when debugging
- to leave reminders where we put things
- to recored wild ideas, and sometimes just to doodle

### Three main benefits of daybook
#### More reliable than memory
#### It gives you a place to store ideas that aren't immediately relevant to the task at hand
- You can continue to concentrate on what you are doing
- Knowing that the grate idea won't be forgotten
#### Acts as a kind of rubber duck
- When you stop to write somethig down, your brai may switch gears, almost as if talking to someone
- A great chance to reflect

### Other benefit
- Every now and then you can look back at what you were doing oh-so-many-years-ago
  - the people
  - the projects
  - the awful clothes and hairstyles

- Try keeping an engineering daybook
  - Use Paper : not a file or a wiki
    - there's something special about the act of writing compared to typing
