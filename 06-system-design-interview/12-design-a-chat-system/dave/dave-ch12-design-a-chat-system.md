# CHAPTER 13: DESIGN A SEARCH AUTOCOMPLETE SYSTEM
```
When searching on Google or shopping at Amazon, as you type in the search box, one or 
more matches for the search term are presented to you. This feature is referred to as 
autocomplete, typeahead, search-as-you-type, or incremental search. Figure 13-1 presents an 
example of a Google search showing a list of autocompleted results when “dinner” is typed 
into the search box. Search autocomplete is an important feature of many products. This leads 
us to the interview question: design a search autocomplete system, also called “design top k” 
or “design top k most searched queries”.
